                            Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manila and extradited to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The arrest was based on an ICC warrant issued through Interpol, citing his role in deadly anti-drug crackdowns from his time as Davao mayor to his presidency. Duterte protested his detention, while his allies, including Vice President Sara Duterte, criticized the Marcos administration for handing him over to a foreign court. His legal team attempted to block his extradition, arguing it violated his rights.  

                            Families of victims killed in Duterte‚Äôs drug war celebrated his arrest, calling it a long-overdue step toward justice. The ICC has been investigating extrajudicial killings under Duterte‚Äôs leadership, with death toll estimates ranging from over 6,000 to as many as 30,000. Despite withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC in 2019 to evade accountability, Duterte‚Äôs attempts to halt the probe failed. While President Marcos Jr. has not rejoined the ICC, his administration cooperated with Interpol‚Äôs request for Duterte‚Äôs arrest.

                            Google will replace Google Assistant with Gemini on Android phones later this year. Assistant will no longer be available on most mobile devices or app stores. Tablets, cars, headphones, watches, and home devices will also transition to Gemini. Google is improving Gemini‚Äôs features, like music playback and lock screen actions, ahead of the switch. More details will be shared in the coming months.
